# ENEM2019 Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis is centered around the ENEM 2019 dataset, which pertains to the Brazilian national high school exams used for university admissions.

Here you can find:
- Jupyter notebook with the code.
- Requirements.

In the "data" folder, you'll find:
- Excel file with a detailed explanation of all variables/microdata.
- The Parquet file with all the data and a Parquet file with only 10\% of the data, in case it's not possible to use the original.

Hope I have assisted, and I welcome any kind of suggestions!
